0.7.1 is a patch release that fixes the desktop icon in the Ubuntu (`.deb`) package (whoops) and adds a splash page link to our recently published [JOSS article](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.08284). Please cite the article if you can: it's a straightforward way for us to measure impact and justify funding further development!
