0.6.0 adds a new model building tutorial (Make a Leg) and relates
it to the model warping tutorial (The Model Warper), which should
significantly help users with those tasks. Additionally, there
were many changes to the software to make these workflows easier
and, of course, various bugfixes.

The two tutorials were the primary focus of our "Building Patient
Specific Models in OpenSim Creator" workshop, presented for
ESMAC 2025.
